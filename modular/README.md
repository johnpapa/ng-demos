## Requirements

- Install Node
	- on OSX install [home brew](https://gist.github.com/DanHerbert/9520689) and type `brew install node`
	- on Windows install [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) and type `choco install nodejs`
- On OSX you can alleviate the need to run as sudo by [following these instructions](https://github.com/sindresorhus/guides/blob/master/npm-global-without-sudo.md). I highly recommend this step on OSX
- Open terminal
- Type `npm install -g node-inspector bower gulp`

## Installing Node.js and Bower Packages
- Open terminal
- Type `npm install`

## Installing Bower Packages
`npm install` will install these too, but you can do it manually.
- Open terminal
- Type `bower install`

## Running
Runs locally, no database required.

### Dev Builds
The dev build does not optimize the deployed code. It simply runs it in place. You can run a dev build in multiple ways.

####Option 1 - Serve
Type `gulp serve-dev` and browse to `http://localhost:7200`

####Option 2 - Serve and Debug Node
Type `gulp serve-dev-debug` and browse to `http://localhost:7200` for the client and `http://localhost:8080/debug?port-5858` to debug the server.

####Option 3 - Serve and Debug Node Breaking on 1st Line
Type `gulp serve-dev-debug-brk` and browse to `http://localhost:7200` for the client and `http://localhost:8080/debug?port-5858` to debug the server.

### Staging Build
The staging build is an optimized build. Type `gulp serve-stage` and browse to `http://localhost:7200`

The optimizations are performed by the gulp tasks and include the following list. See the `gulpfile.js` for details

- jshint
- preparing Angular's templatecache for html templates
- concat task to bundle css and js, separately
- Angular dependency injection annotations using ngAnnotate
- uglify to minify and mangle javascript
- source maps
- css autoprefixer for vendor prefixes
- minify css
- optimize images
- index.html injection for scripts and links
- deploying all js, css, images, fonts, and index.html

## Testing
Type `gulp test` to run the tests including both unit and midway tests (spins up a server). This will create a watch on the files, with a 5 second delay, to run the tests.

Testing uses karma, mocha, chai, sinon, ngMidwayTester libraries.

## How It Works
The app is quite simple and has 2 main routes:
- dashboard
- avengers list

### The Modules
The app has 4 feature modules and depends on a series of external modules and custom but cross-app modules

```
app --> [
        app.avengers,
        app.dashboard,
        app.layout,
        app.widgets,
		app.core --> [
			ngAnimate,
			ngRoute,
			ngSanitize,
			blocks.exception,
			blocks.logger,
			blocks.router
		]
    ]
```

## core Module
Core modules are ones that are shared throughout the entire application and may be customized for the specific application. Example might be common data services.

This is an aggregator of modules that the application will need. The `core` module takes the blocks, common, and Angular sub-modules as dependencies. 

## blocks Modules
Block modules are reusable blocks of code that can be used across projects simply by including them as dependencies.

### blocks.logger Module
The `blocks.logger` module handles logging across the Angular app.

### blocks.exception Module
The `blocks.exception` module handles exceptions across the Angular app.

It depends on the `blocks.logger` module, because the implementation logs the exceptions.

### blocks.router Module
The `blocks.router` module contains a routing helper module that assists in adding routes to the $routeProvider.

## node-inspector

### Quick Start
1. Install globally
    `npm install -g node-inspector`
    
2. Run server, load it in the browser
    `node-debug server/server.js`
    
    This loads http://localhost:8080/debug?port-5858 with the node code in the Chrome debugger

### Manually Run in One Terminal Tab
Run the server with options, and debug
    
`node --debug=5858 server/server.js & node-inspector`    

Or

`node-inspector & node --debug server/server.js`

 - Note: Debug defaults to 5858

### Manual Run and Break on First Line
Run the server and have it break on the first line of code 
    `node-inspector & node --debug-brk server/server.js`

### Run in its own Tab
Or run node-inspector in a separate Terminal tab. You can keep it running and just serve and shutdown your site as needed

### node-inspector with Gulp
Alternative to running node-inspector in its own tab is to use `gulp-shell`

```javascript
gulp.src('', {read: false})
    .pipe(plug.shell(['node-inspector']));
```

Run `gulp serve-dev-debug` or `gulp serve-dev-debug-brk` to debug node via the Gulp tasks in this project.

### Issues 

####If a process stays connected find it and kill with these commands

```
lsof -i TCP|fgrep LISTEN
kill -9 34608
```    

####Set up some aliases for the Mac

Edit the bash profile

    nano ~/.bash_profile

Enter the aliases

    /usr/local/bin
    alias lsp='sudo lsof -i -n -P | grep LISTEN'

    alias cdmod='cd _git/ng-demos/modular'

    alias gadd='git add . -A'

CTRL-X and save

Source the file

    source ~/.bash_profile
